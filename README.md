# 🎯 Lead Scoring - Case Study

This project focuses on analyzing and scoring leads for a business, helping identify which potential customers are most likely to convert. By leveraging data science techniques, we can prioritize high-quality leads and improve the efficiency of marketing and sales teams.

---

## 🧾 Problem Statement

Businesses generate numerous leads through online and offline campaigns, but not all leads result in conversions. The objective is to **identify the key factors** that determine whether a lead is likely to become a customer, using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and classification modeling.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Understand lead behavior and characteristics through EDA  
- Identify high-conversion lead features  
- Build a classification model to predict lead conversion  
- Provide actionable insights for marketing and sales optimization

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Model Evaluation)

---

## 🔍 Key EDA Steps

- Dataset overview and missing value treatment
- Analysis of lead source, time, tags, etc.
- Bivariate analysis with respect to target variable (`Converted`)
- Feature selection and transformation

---

## 🧠 Modeling

- Logistic Regression
- Feature selection using RFE
- Model evaluation using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC-AUC Curve

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Certain lead sources and tags strongly indicate conversion likelihood
- Repeated interaction increases conversion chances
- Targeted communication strategies can significantly boost lead quality

---

## 🔮 Recommendations

- Focus on high-performing channels and lead sources
- Nurture leads with high interaction frequency
- Improve handling of leads with missing or generic information
